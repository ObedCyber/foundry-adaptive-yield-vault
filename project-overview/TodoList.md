Absolutely, Obed. Here's a complete and structured **TODO list** that walks you through everything needed to build your **Autonomous Token Allocator (DeFi Robo-Vault)** project — from zero to hackathon-ready submission.

---

## ✅ Autonomous Token Allocator – TODO List

> ✅ **Goal**: Build an ERC4626 vault that automatically rebalances user funds into the best-performing yield strategy using modular plugins and optional Chainlink automation.

---

### 🟢 1. Project Setup

* [ ✅ ] Initialize project using **Foundry**

  * `forge init autonomous-robo-vault`
* [ ✅ ] Set up `foundry.toml` with Solidity version and optimizer
* [ ✅ ] Install `forge-std` for testing
* [ ✅ ] Create base folder structure:

  ```
  contracts/
    RoboVault.sol
    BaseStrategy.sol
    MockStrategy.sol
    StrategyManager.sol
    RoboKeeper.sol
    Errors.sol
  script/
  test/
  ```

---

### 🔧 2. Base Contracts

#### 🏦 Vault (ERC4626)

* [ ✅ ] Write `RoboVault.sol` using ERC4626 pattern
* [ ✅ ] Implement:

  * `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `totalAssets()` ✔️
  * Track current `activeStrategy` 🟨
  * Forward funds to strategy on deposit 🟨

#### ⚙️ Base Strategy Interface

* [ ✅ ] Create `BaseStrategy.sol` interface or abstract contract

  * Required functions: `deposit(uint256)`, `withdraw(uint256)`, `estimateAPY()`
* [ ✅ ] Implement proper access control to allow only the vault to interact

---

### 🧪 3. Strategy Plugins

#### 🧸 Mock Strategies

* [ ] Build `MockStrategyA` and `MockStrategyB`

  * Set fake APYs (e.g., 5%, 8%)
  * Track internal balances for deposits/withdrawals

#### (Optional) Real DeFi Strategies

* [ ] Integrate a live protocol (e.g., Aave or Compound) as `AaveStrategy`

---

### ⚖️ 4. Strategy Manager

* [ ] Build `StrategyManager.sol`

  * Compare all strategies’ `estimateAPY()`
  * Score and return the best one

* [ ] Add `rebalance()` logic:

  * Withdraw from current strategy
  * Deposit to new optimal strategy

* [ ] Connect manager to `RoboVault.sol`

  * On `rebalance()`, RoboVault asks manager which strategy to switch to

---

### 🔁 5. Chainlink Integration (Optional but powerful)

#### ⏱️ Chainlink Automation

* [ ] Build `RoboKeeper.sol`

  * `checkUpkeep()`: returns `true` if APY diff justifies a rebalance
  * `performUpkeep()`: calls `RoboVault.rebalance()`
* [ ] Deploy on Sepolia/Base testnet
* [ ] Register Keeper on Chainlink testnet registry

#### 📈 Chainlink Price Feeds (optional)

* [ ] Use feeds to normalize APY across different tokens or stablecoins

---

### 🔬 6. Testing

#### Unit Tests

* [ ] Test `RoboVault` deposit/withdraw
* [ ] Test `MockStrategy` deposit/withdraw/APY
* [ ] Test `StrategyManager` picks best strategy

#### Integration Tests

* [ ] Simulate APY change
* [ ] Trigger rebalancing logic and assert fund movement
* [ ] Test vault accounting after rebalance

#### Foundry

* [ ] Use `forge test --gas-report` for gas profiling
* [ ] Use `vm.warp()` to simulate time passing
* [ ] Use `vm.prank()` to simulate user vs keeper

---

### 🌍 7. Deployment

* [ ] Deploy mock strategies and vault to Sepolia/Base testnet
* [ ] Fund vault with test USDC
* [ ] Log deployed addresses in `README.md` or `.env`

---

### 🧑‍🎤 8. Optional Frontend Demo

* [ ] Create a simple frontend (Thirdweb, HTML, or React)

  * Show:

    * Total vault deposits
    * Current APY
    * Active strategy
    * Rebalance button (manual or simulate upkeep)
* [ ] Connect using Ethers.js, Viem, or Wagmi

---

### 📄 9. Documentation

* [x] `workflow.md` explaining architecture ✅
* [ ] `README.md`:

  * ✅ What the vault does
  * ✅ How to run/test/deploy
  * ✅ Contract addresses
* [ ] Include Mermaid architecture diagram
* [ ] Add performance & gas metrics if possible

---

### 🚀 10. Hackathon Submission Checklist

* [ ] Title, tagline, and project description
* [ ] Team + tech stack
* [ ] Key features
* [ ] Screenshots (UI and diagrams)
* [ ] Video demo (optional)
* [ ] GitHub repo link
* [ ] Deployed testnet link

---

## 🧠 Advanced / Stretch Goals

* [ ] Add fee mechanism (e.g., 10% of yield goes to treasury)
* [ ] Multi-token vault support (DAI, ETH, USDC)
* [ ] Emergency withdraw mode
* [ ] Add Irys integration to log strategy history
