# 📄 `workflow.md`

> **Project:** Autonomous Token Allocator (DeFi Robo-Vault)
> **Purpose:** Yield-maximizing ERC4626 vault that dynamically reallocates capital across different yield strategies based on APY, gas cost, and performance.

## 🔁 3. Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Core Vault and Strategy Plugin System

✅ Tasks:

* Implement `RoboVault.sol` as an ERC4626-compliant vault
* Create `BaseStrategy` abstract contract with:

  * `deposit(uint256)`
  * `withdraw(uint256)`
  * `estimateAPY() returns (uint256)`
* Build `MockStrategy.sol` to simulate yield (return tunable fake APYs)

---

### Phase 2: Strategy Rebalancing Logic

✅ Tasks:

* Create `StrategyManager.sol` to:

  * Compare strategies using `estimateAPY()`
  * Return the best one
  * Validate strategy health (e.g., TVL caps, slippage tolerance)
* In `RoboVault.sol`, add:

  * `rebalance()` → withdraw from current, deposit into best
  * Internal tracking of active strategy

---

### Phase 3: Chainlink Automation Integration (Optional)

✅ Tasks:

* Deploy `RoboKeeper.sol` with:

  * `checkUpkeep()` — checks if it's time to rebalance
  * `performUpkeep()` — triggers `RoboVault.rebalance()`
* Register the keeper on Chainlink testnet registry
* Add interval timing (e.g., once every 6 hours)

---

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

✅ Tasks:

* Unit tests for:

  * Strategy deposits, withdrawals
  * Rebalance execution
* Integration tests:

  * Simulate APY change in strategy
  * Test switching logic from MockStrategy A → B
* Gas snapshot using `forge test --gas-report`

---

### Phase 5: Deployment and Demo

✅ Tasks:

* Deploy contracts to Sepolia/Base Goerli
* Use testnet stablecoins (USDC)
* Deploy 2–3 `MockStrategy` plugins with different APYs
* Deploy `RoboVault`, connect it to strategies

✅ Bonus:

* Integrate a **simple frontend** to show:

  * Vault APY
  * Active strategy
  * User deposits and shares
  * Trigger rebalance button

---

## 🔒 4. Security & Best Practices

* ✅ **Custom Errors** — all core errors use custom Solidity errors for gas savings
* ✅ **Reentrancy Guards** — especially around deposits/withdrawals
* ✅ **Slippage checks** — avoid under-withdraws or bad rebalances
* ✅ **Strategy validation** — sanity checks for APY and token compatibility
* ✅ **Upgradeable?** — (optional) prepare for proxies or registry-based upgrade pattern

## 🧠 5. Smart Contract Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept                | How it's Used                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ERC-4626               | Vault token standard with share/asset accounting |
| Interfaces & Abstracts | Strategy plugin system                           |
| Modularity             | Swappable strategies and external manager        |
| Chainlink              | Price feeds (future) & Automation (optional)     |
| Gas Optimization       | Custom errors, caching, `calldata`, etc.         |
| Security Patterns      | Reentrancy, validation, slippage tolerance       |

---

## 🌍 6. Deployment Addresses (Testnets)

| Contract       | Address | Chain   |
| -------------- | ------- | ------- |
| RoboVault      | `0x...` | Sepolia |
| MockStrategy A | `0x...` | Sepolia |
| MockStrategy B | `0x...` | Sepolia |
| RoboKeeper     | `0x...` | Sepolia |

(*Fill these in after deployment*)

---

## 🚀 7. Future Improvements

* Support real DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound)
* Gas-aware APY scoring (subtract estimated tx cost)
* Fee mechanism for vault creator
* Multi-token vaults (ETH, USDC, DAI, wBTC)
* Strategy history and analytics on Irys
